Hi, my name is Joshua Saxby â€”I'm a software developer soon to graduate from university.

I've been programming for a little over a decade now, to a professional level for several years.

My professional experience is mostly in web dev, but I also have some Windows desktop application experience.

### Projects I am particularly proud of:
