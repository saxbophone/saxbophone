Hi, my name is Joshua Saxby â€”I'm a software developer soon to graduate from university, and _I'm looking for work!_

I've been programming for a little over a decade now, to a professional level for several years.

My professional experience is mostly in web dev, but I also have some Windows desktop application experience.

I am looking for software dev work using a language more close-to-the-metal like C or C++, and I believe most of my personal projects on here reflect this!

### Projects I am particularly proud of:
